# ITHuset.DDD.AntiMalware
This is a boilerplate for an exercise in applied DDD with .Net Core.

The boilerplate consists of:
* A REST API with Controllers and HTTP methods
* An API model (DTOs)
* OpenApi (Swagger) setup at the URL: /swagger
* API error handling: https://github.com/khellang/Middleware
* Base class for ValueObjects
* A unit test project using MSTEST2 and Shouldly - But you can use any test framework you want.
  * Docs for Shouldly: http://docs.shouldly-lib.net/
* Postman collection for testing
* See an example of a Repository in the folder 'Examples', which just stores objects in-memory, and generates an Id. This is considered good enough for this exercise.

## Installation requirements
* Visual Studio 2019 - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
* .Net Core SDK 2.2.x (latest) - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core

## Run the application
* Select ITHuset.DDD.AntiMalware.Api as Startup Project.
* Run the application with IIS Express. 
* Choose to trust the IIS Express self-signed certificate.
* Go to /swagger to view and run the API methods.
* Test using Postman or OpenAPI

## Postman
* Download and install from https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/
* Start it and import the file postman_collection.json
* To run Postman against your IIS Express, you must turn off 'SSL certificate validation' (Settings > General).
* Define a global variable (or environment variable) with name 'baseUrl' that points to your IIS Express URL (for example https://localhost:44393)
